Christine Rostek will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of emails sent or received. Security measures have been completed on this site to ensure that your information is secure. However, there remain risks associated with using email, such as email being sent to the wrong person, inappropriately circulated, or inappropriately stored on a computer. The information contained in the email will only be used for the purpose of OT service delivery and email communication will cease when the client is discharged from the OT service. <br>

The information will be collected and shared with others as necessary to provide health care, communicate with other health providers, receive payment for health care through third-party payers, or to report as required by law. <br>
